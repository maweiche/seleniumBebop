# seleniumBebop

The goal of this project is to build a "Bot" that can perform automated, repetitive tasks you come across on the internet. For the premise of this build, it will be catered towards the "Giant Cookie" game where you click the cookie for points and are granted bonuses to earn points faster. 

Our aim:
-Automate bot to consistently click cookie at a set timed interval
-Automate bot to select bonuses/upgrades when they are made available
